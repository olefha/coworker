The total raw material volume received on October 17, 2024, was 25338.86 liters. 
The total production volume on October 18, 2024, was 18867.03 liters. 

To calculate the yield based on input raw material volume and output production:
\[ \text{Yield} = \frac{\text{Total Production Volume}}{\text{Total Raw Material Volume}} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Yield} = \frac{18867.03}{25338.86} \approx 0.744 \]

Therefore, the yield based on the input raw material volume and output production was approximately 0.744 or 74.4%.

To calculate the yield based on these values:
Yield = (Total Production Volume / Total Raw Material Volume) * 100

Yield = (18867.03 / 20116.36) * 100
Yield ≈ 93.75%

The yield based on the input raw material volume and output production was approximately 93.75%.

-- Actual Answer:
On October 18, 2024:
- The total raw material input volume was 20116.36 liters.
- The total production volume was 18867.03 liters.

To calculate the yield based on these values, we can use the formula:
\[ \text{Yield} (\%) = \left( \frac{\text{Total Production Volume}}{\text{Total Raw Material Volume}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \text{Yield} (\%) = \left( \frac{18867.03}{20116.36} \right) \times 100 \]

Calculating the yield:
\[ \text{Yield} (\%) = \left( \frac{18867.03}{20116.36} \right) \times 100 \approx 93.79\% \]

Therefore, the yield based on the input raw material volume and output production on October 18, 2024, was approximately 93.79%.

Based on the process data from the last 24 hours (October 18, 2024), there were variations in temperature, pressure, and flow rate. The temperature varied by 21.40, the pressure by 33.40, and the flow rate by 240.90. These variations indicate some instability in the process during that period.
-- Expected (Reference):
The Cpk (Process Capability Index) is 0.23 of the process in the last day indicating that we are not within the specification limits and thus the process was not stable.

Q: Was the process stable?
-- Actual Answer:
Based on the process data from October 18, 2024, the stability of the processes varied:
- The Homogenization process had fluctuations in temperature (ranging from 60.80 to 72.70), pressure (ranging from 142.70 to 160.50), and flow rate (ranging from 761.80 to 841.50).
- The Pasteurization process also showed variations in temperature (51.30), pressure (176.10), and flow rate (600.60).
Overall, the process stability may need further evaluation due to the observed fluctuations in the parameters.

Q: Was the process stable?
-- Actual Answer:
To determine if the process was stable in the last 24 hours, we can analyze the variation in temperature, pressure, and flow rate. 

The standard deviations of these parameters are:
- Temperature: 10.72
- Pressure: 16.71
- Flow rate: 122.73

A process is considered stable when the variation in its parameters is within acceptable limits. In this case, the high standard deviation of flow rate indicates significant variation, which may suggest instability in the process related to flow rate. However, the temperature and pressure variations are relatively lower, indicating better stability in those aspects. Overall, the process may not be completely stable due to the high flow rate variation.

Q: Was the process stable?
-- Actual Answer:
To determine if the process was stable, we can analyze the standard deviations of key process parameters such as temperature, pressure, and flow rate. 

The standard deviations calculated for the process data on October 18, 2024, were:
- Temperature deviation: approximately 10.72
- Pressure deviation: approximately 16.71
- Flow rate deviation: approximately 122.73

Based on these values, the process does not appear to be stable, especially considering the high deviation in the flow rate. Further investigation and corrective actions may be necessary to ensure process stability and consistency.

Q: Was the process stable?
-- Actual Answer:
To determine if the process was stable in the last 24 hours (October 18, 2024), we can assess the process stability based on the standard deviations of key parameters such as temperature, pressure, and flow rate. 

The standard deviations calculated for the process data entries on October 18, 2024, were:
- Temperature variation: approximately 10.72
- Pressure variation: approximately 16.71
- Flow rate variation: approximately 122.73

Based on these standard deviations, particularly the high variation in flow rate, it indicates that the process may not have been entirely stable. The significant variation in flow rate suggests potential fluctuations that could impact process stability. Further investigation and analysis may be needed to address and improve process stability.

   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Action Taken:** Conducted additional pasteurization cycle

2. **Processes Data:**
   - The processes that occurred between '2024-10-18 00:00:00' and '2024-10-19 00:00:00' were:
     1. Process Name: Homogenization, Temperature: 72.70, Pressure: 160.50, Flow Rate: 761.80
     2. Process Name: Homogenization, Temperature: 60.80, Pressure: 142.70, Flow Rate: 841.50
     3. Process Name: Pasteurization, Temperature: 51.30, Pressure: 176.10, Flow Rate: 600.60

3. **Shift Process Logs:**
   - The log entries for the shift date '2024-10-18' were:
     1. Afternoon shift: Routine operations performed. No significant issues reported.
     2. Night shift: Minor equipment malfunction observed. Maintenance team notified.
     3. Morning shift: Routine operations performed. No significant issues reported.

4. **Similar Past Nonconformities:**
   - There were 3 nonconformity records related to high bacterial count in raw milk in the past. These records included instances of high spoilage rate and low protein content. Actions taken to address these issues included improving storage conditions, conducting training for handling, and procuring milk from higher-quality suppliers. The severity of the issues varied from medium to high.

In summary, the deviations on October 18, 2024, were primarily attributed to a high bacterial count in raw milk, leading to the implementation of an additional pasteurization cycle to address the issue. The process data and shift logs did not directly indicate any other significant deviations or root causes for the day.
-- Expected (Reference):
