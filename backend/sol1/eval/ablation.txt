Q: How can we reduce deviations in the future?
-- Actual Answer:
To reduce deviations in the future and improve overall quality control, the following measures can be implemented based on the historical data and actions taken:

1. Implement Strict Quality Checks: Enhance quality control measures at the raw material intake stage to detect issues like high bacterial count early on.

2. Supplier Evaluation: Conduct thorough evaluations of raw material suppliers to ensure consistent quality and adherence to standards.

3. Training and Education: Provide training to staff on proper handling, storage, and processing techniques to prevent contamination and maintain quality.

4. Process Optimization: Continuously monitor and optimize processes to minimize deviations and ensure consistent product quality.

5. Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits and inspections to identify potential issues and take corrective actions promptly.

6. Enhanced Documentation: Maintain detailed records of non-conformities, root causes, and actions taken for future reference and improvement.

By implementing these strategies, the dairy plant can proactively reduce deviations, enhance product quality, and maintain operational efficiency.
